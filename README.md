# Movie Tiers

This project is in progress!

The goal of movie tiers is to make a "tier list" of your favorite movies, so you can rank the movies you have seen from best to worst! [The Movie Database Api](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api "The Movie Database Api") is used to search all movies, and [React-Beautiful-Dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd "React-Beautiful-Dnd") is used  for the sleek drag and drop functionality.

Tech stack:
- **MongoDB**
- **Express.JS**
- **React.JS**
- **Node.JS**

as of right now, the project is configured for a dev environment, and as to not expose my mongoDb password, there is one file excluded from this repository, /config/mongoPass.js, which exports the mongoDb password.
