#Movie Tiers

This project is in progress!

The goal of movie tiers is to make a "tier list" of your favorite movies, so you can rank the movies you have seen from best to worst! [The Movie Database Api](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api "The Movie Database Api") is used to search all movies, and [React-Beautiful-Dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd "React-Beautiful-Dnd") is used  for the sleek drag and drop functionality.

Tech stack:
- **MongoDB**
- **Express.JS**
- **React.JS**
- **Node.JS**
